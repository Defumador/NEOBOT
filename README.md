## NEOBOT

NEOBOT is a free and open image-recognition bot that runs on top of the EVE client GUI. All interactions with the EVE client are randomized in both time and location.

Currently the bot supports hauling, autopilot, and mining functions.  

The bot was originally written in AutoHotkey but has been rewritten in Python 3. AHK files have been preserved for archival purposes.
