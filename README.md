## NEOBOT

NEOBOT is a free and open image-recognition bot that runs on top of the EVE client GUI. All interactions with the EVE client are randomized in both time and location.

Currently the bot supports hauling, autopilot, and mining functions.  

##### No client injection, no memory dumping, and no packet hacking. The bot interacts with the game the same way a human would: with the mouse and keyboard.


#### Dependencies:
-pyautogui (https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui)
