# NEOBOT
NEOBOT is a color and image-based bot that acts through gui interaction running on top of the EVE client. All interactions with the client via mouse clicks are randomized by both time and location.

Currently the bot only supports hauling and/or autopilot functions as a proof of concept but the framework for other scripts (like a miner) is mostly present.
