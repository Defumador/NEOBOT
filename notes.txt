mining script:
- capture 'target-locked' versions of asteroid icons so script knows when a
target has been sucessfully locked. see the 1h12m mark on video
D/screen_recordings/2019-07-04_21-08-19
- add support for a 'don't recall drones when escaping pcs or npcs' variable,
which could be useful in losec space when it's necessary to quickly escape
ships when they arrive on grid







-test situation when ship is at dest9 to see if dest checking loop works fully
-NOT READY FOR TESTING IN LOSEC YET

features:
-add support for 'icons' style inventory view
-resize session change icons to only include cyan ring on left side to give script more time to check for image
-add player-owned structures support
-GUI
-add a small chance for a semli-long wait after each jump/undock for increased randomness, make sure session change
timer doesn't expire though as it would leave ship vulnerable in low-sec systems
-add image recognition for yellow-highlighted entries in people & places
