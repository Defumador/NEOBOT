test 123
testing:
-test situation when ship is at dest9 to see if dest checking loop works fully
-NOT READY FOR TESTING IN LOSEC YET

bugs:
-script thinks dest10 is actually dest1 because they both start with a "1"; max # of destinations is 9 for now

features:
-add support for 'icons' style inventory view
-resize session change icons to only include cyan ring on left side to give script more time to check for image
-add player-owned structures support
-GUI
-add a small chance for a semli-long wait after each jump/undock for increased randomness, make sure session change
timer doesn't expire though as it would leave ship vulnerable in low-sec systems
-add image recognition for yellow-highlighted entries in people & places
